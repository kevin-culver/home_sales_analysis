## Overview

The aim of the current project was to provide actionable insights for...

## Business Problem

Creating a successful movie studio takes time, money, and risk. However, a company cannot predict how the movies it produces will be received. Therefore, the point of this analysis was to find what qualities are shared by high grossing films that make them successful. For the present analysis, four questions were asked:
1. *What movie genres are most successful?*
2. *What time of year is best to release films?*
3. *Does budget size impact a movie's profit?*
4. *How does a movie's rating affect its profitability?*

By analyzing these questions, business recommendations can be provided that will assist Microsoft in making informed decisions about what types of films to create, when to release films, and other metrics to achieve. 


## Data

The data used in this project comes from two online movie databases - IMDb and The Numbers. Within these databases, each movie is identified by its title or movie id. When combined, these databases provide comprehensive information for each movie, including its genre, rating, release date, budget, and total gross (both domestic and worldwide).

## Methods

This project primarily uses descriptive analysis. The data was analyzed by organizing movies categorically (e.g., by genre) or by visualizing variables using distributions. By visualizing the data using distributions, patterns, relationships, and trends were easy to document and evaluate. 


## Results

For each business question, the results are briefly summarized followed by a visualization of the results.



## Conclusions



## Next Steps

To further improve on the analysis done in this project. The following steps are recommended:
